					XACML Editor v1.3
			==============================================



1.- Introduction

	
	The University of Murcia (UMU) has developed an XACML policy definition software in Java called UMU-XACML-Editor. 
	This is just an small part of a significative research effort on using different XML-related standards and technologies,
	such as XACML and SAML, to solve different scenarios on authentication and authorization of users and devices when accessing a network and the resources existing in that network.
	The UMU-XACML-Editor is actually intended to cover XACML 1.0 and 2.0 standard policies as defined by the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC.
